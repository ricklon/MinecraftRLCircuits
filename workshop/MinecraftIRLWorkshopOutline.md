Minecraft IRL, Outline

It would be nice if the projects could also be available in adventure mode. 

Concepts in minecraft that have similar logic to real world logic:

Routing water

Routing lava

Door controls

**=== Section 1: Basics: Torches, Buttons, Levers and breadboards ===**

===== 45 minutes ===

1. Getting Started, Hello World, and Hellow Inputs

    1. The torch

        1. Breadboard, LED, resistor, battery

    2. The button (or pressure plate)

        2. Button, Breadboard, LED, resistor, battery

    3. The lever

        3. Switch,  Breadboard, LED, resistor, battery

WIre the we have the basic input, and output breadboard structure.

2. AND concept

* Buttons, and Switches in series

* Redstone buttons, switches in series

3. OR concept

Button, and switches in parallel

* Redstone buttons, switches in parallel

4. Create a Truth table for your 2 bits

Outcome: 

* Basic wiring

* Breadboarding inputs, outputs, and power

* LEDs

* Truthtable

**==== Section 2: Electronic switches, and more logic =====**

4. Transistor Concept

A. What kind of switch is a transistor

* As long as it has power it like a lever. Remembering if itâ€™s on or off.

B. AND concept

* transistors Buttons, and Switches in series

* Redstone buttons, switches in series

C. OR concept

* transistor Button, and switches in parallel

* Redstone buttons, switches in parallel

D. NOT

E. NAND

F. XOR

4.  Experimentation and exploration

* build a thing that does X

**=== Section 3: Logic circuits, Adding binary numbers ===**

=== 45-60 minutes ===

5. 7400 Series logic, parts needed

XOR

Binary numbers

Half Adders

Full Adder

**==== Bonus: All the other circuits in Minecraft ===**

===== 45 minutes ====

6. Minecraft Comparators, and other specialty circuits in real life

* repeater

* diode

* Comparator

* Clock

* Pulse circuit

* Memory circuit
